# Project Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

**⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE**: WhoSampled.com has anti-bot protection that blocks automated HTTP requests with 403 Forbidden errors. This affects the core functionality of this MCP server.

## Current Status

### What We Tested (2025-10-28)

1. **Minimal HTTP requests** → 403 Forbidden
2. **Browser-like headers** → 403 Forbidden
3. **Enhanced User-Agent strings** → 403 Forbidden
4. **Direct scraper access** → 403 Forbidden

All automated access attempts are blocked, likely by Cloudflare or similar protection.

### Project History

- **Created**: 2025-10-28 (very new project)
- **Not verified**: No evidence of successful real-world usage yet
- **PR #1 merged**: Initial implementation, but real-world testing status unknown

## Root Cause

WhoSampled employs anti-bot measures that detect:
- Automated HTTP clients (httpx, requests, etc.)
- Missing browser fingerprints
- Suspicious request patterns
- Cloud/datacenter IP addresses

## Impact on Functionality

### ❌ Currently Non-Functional
- `search_track()` - Cannot fetch search results
- `get_track_details()` - Cannot fetch track details
- All MCP tools that depend on web scraping

### ✅ Functional
- Unit tests with mocked responses
- Code structure and MCP integration
- Response formatting logic

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Headless Browser (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Most reliable for bypassing anti-bot measures
- Renders JavaScript like a real browser
- Can handle Cloudflare challenges

**Cons:**
- Higher resource usage
- Slower response times
- More dependencies

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to dependencies
"playwright>=1.40.0"  # or selenium

# Update scraper to use headless browser
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def fetch_with_browser(url):
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch()
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto(url)
        content = await page.content()
        await browser.close()
        return content
```

### Option 2: API Access
**Check if WhoSampled offers:**
- Official API (paid or free)
- Partnership/developer program
- Data licensing

**Pros:**
- Reliable and supported
- No anti-bot issues
- Better performance

**Cons:**
- May require payment
- May have usage limits
- May not exist

### Option 3: Proxy/Residential IPs
**Use services like:**
- ScraperAPI
- Bright Data
- Oxylabs

**Pros:**
- Handles anti-bot automatically
- Rotating IPs
- Managed infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Ongoing costs
- External dependency
- May violate ToS

### Option 4: Rate Limiting + Delays
**Add intelligent delays:**
- Random delays between requests (5-15 seconds)
- Session management
- Cookie persistence
- Request from residential IP

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Lower resource usage

**Cons:**
- May still be blocked
- Slow user experience
- Not guaranteed to work

### Option 5: Accept Limitations
**Redesign as:**
- Manual data input tool
- Cache-based service
- Hybrid manual/auto approach

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Document the limitation** in README.md
2. **Add disclaimer** about anti-bot protection
3. **Test from different network** (residential IP, not datacenter)
4. **Contact WhoSampled** about API or official access
5. **Choose and implement** one of the solutions above

## Testing Recommendations

### Before implementing solutions:

1. **Test from local machine** (not server/cloud)
   ```bash
   # Clone and run from your home internet
   git clone <repo>
   cd whosampled-connector-mcp
   pip install -e .
   python -c "from whosampled_connector.scraper import WhoSampledScraper; import asyncio; asyncio.run(WhoSampledScraper().search_track('Daft Punk', 'One More Time'))"
   ```

2. **Check with VPN** from different locations

3. **Monitor for rate limiting** patterns

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Terms of Service**: Review WhoSampled ToS for scraping policy
- **robots.txt**: Check https://www.whosampled.com/robots.txt
- **Respect rate limits**: Don't overwhelm their servers
- **Consider API**: Official access is always preferable

## Conclusion

**This project is currently NOT FEASIBLE without modifications.** The anti-bot protection prevents all automated access.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement headless browser solution (Playwright)
2. Add comprehensive error handling for 403 errors
3. Update README with clear warnings
4. Test from residential network
5. Consider contacting WhoSampled for official API access

## Questions for Project Owner

1. Have you successfully run this against live WhoSampled.com?
2. What network/IP did you test from?
3. Did you encounter 403 errors?
4. Are there specific conditions when it works?
5. Would you consider using a headless browser approach?
